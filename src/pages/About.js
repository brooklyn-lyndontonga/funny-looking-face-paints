      <h1>The Funny Looking Story</h1>
      <p>Kia ora! Ko Brooky ahau — māmā, face painter, and CEO of creativity at Funny Looking Face Paints. My face painting journey started off at my baby’s first birthday when I ordered a set of professional face paints and brushes and thought, “Eh, how hard can it be?”, Famous last words.</p>
      <p>Now I run a one-wāhine show where glitter is a priority, tamariki are the real bosses, and the vibe is always Whānau First. My kaupapa is simple: bring joy, colour, and a bit of that magic to every occasion — whether it’s a birthday, a whanau day at the Pā, or You're a Grown Up who just wants your tamaiti to sit still for 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>I’m not fancy — just passionate. Passionate about our tamariki, whānau, and those messy, blissful moments where your kid is frothing because they are now a rainbow-unicorn-dinosaur-mermaid hybrid. If the paint’s a bit crooked, kei te pai. If the kids are smiling, that’s the real masterpiece.</p>
